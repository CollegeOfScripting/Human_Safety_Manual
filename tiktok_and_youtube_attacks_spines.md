Tik Tok and Youtube contain HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of videos teaching people to use a "CHIROBOARD" to "CRACK" their Spine.

Tik Tok and Youtube do NOT put WARNING labels on these DANGEROUS videos!

The problem with the "CHIROBOARD" is that the human spine is NOT meant to be pushed in with pressure.

The human spine has NERVES and DISCS that cannot have TOO much pressure applied to them without tragedy!

The "CHIROBOARD" is designed as an ARCH which pushes into the spine.

In addition, the board has a strip of material that stands up from the board itself, in the middle, where contact with the spine is made.

On the sides of the board are HARD PLASTIC KNOBS, which are also very dangerous for the spine.

Likely consequences of using the "CHIROBOARD" are:

* Paralysis of Some or All Limbs
* Inability to Move
* Inability to Walk
* Inability to Get Up
* Slipped Discs in the Back
* Nerve Damage from Pressure Applied to the Spine
* Possible Permanent Spine Damage

The videos being shown on Tik Tok and Youtube have FAKE Sound Effects ADDED!

The people in the videos are NOT actually cracking their spines at all!

The videos are a military attack from country X, trying to damage the spines of a nation, prior to the world conflict!

The videos maliciously teach the audience to slam their spine down onto the "CHIROBOARD" with strong force.

The act of applying strong pressure to the spine very often results in serious spine and/or nerve damage.

Some of the "CHIROBOARD" videos show the person using 3 boards stacked on top of each other.

Some of the "CHIROBOARD" videos even tell the person that it is NOT dangerous, when in fact it is VERY dangerous!

Remember: NEVER APPLY PRESSURE TO THE SPINE!

TIK TOK AND YOUTUBE ARE BEING USED BY COUNTRY X TO TRY TO HARM YOU.

DO NOT ALLOW KIDS TO USE TIK TOK OR YOUTUBE WITHOUT SUPERVISION, BECAUSE THE KIDS ARE BEING TARGETTED BY COUNTRY X, ON THOSE AND OTHER PLATFORMS!
